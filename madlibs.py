#string concatenation aka(puting strings together)
#I will use an f string
adj = input ("adjective:")# in put any adjective eg(nice)
verb1= input("verb:")# a verb like(discovering)
verb2= input("verb:")#name of the variable
famous_person= input("famous person:")#prompt
madlib=f"coding is so {adj}!  it makes me excited all the time because I love  {verb1}. Stay focused and don't forget to {verb2}. At the end you will fly high like {famous_person} ! "
